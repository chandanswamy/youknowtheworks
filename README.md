This project is based on the assignment supplied by the firm You Know The Works. 
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used to create this project.
In this project, we employed all of the basic, common, and sophisticated functionalities. 
This project was created using Responsive web design.

The project at hand is for screens ranging in size from medium to extra-large. 
However, by utilising adaptable web design, we were able to modify the project such that it is accessible to small and extra-small devices.

Over time, I made minor changes to the design for extremely small and small displays. 
I hope the project is well-built and successful.
